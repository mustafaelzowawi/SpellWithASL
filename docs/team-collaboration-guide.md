# Team Collaboration Guide

## 🤝 Git Workflow & Collaboration Strategy

### Branch Strategy
```
main
├── feature/frontend-webcam-integration    (Teammate 1)
├── feature/backend-api-endpoints          (Teammate 2)
├── feature/ai-model-training              (Teammate 3)
├── feature/mediapipe-integration          (Teammate 3)
└── feature/deployment-setup               (All)
```

### Daily Workflow

#### Morning Sync (15 minutes)
1. **Standup Meeting**: What did you complete yesterday? What are you working on today? Any blockers?
2. **Branch Updates**: Pull latest changes from main
3. **Integration Check**: Verify your local environment works with teammates' latest changes

#### Repository Setup (First Time)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mustafaelzowawi/SpellWithASL.git
cd SpellWithASL

# Set up your local environment
./tools/quick-start.sh
```

#### Development Cycle
```bash
# Start of day - sync with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create/switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-component-name
# or
git checkout feature/your-component-name
git rebase main  # Keep your branch up to date

# Work on your features
# Make frequent small commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement webcam capture component"

# Push changes regularly
git push origin feature/your-component-name
```

#### End of Day
```bash
# Push your progress
git push origin feature/your-component-name

# Create PR if feature is ready for review
```

### API Contracts (MUST BE FOLLOWED)

#### Frontend → Backend
```typescript
// POST /predict
interface PredictionRequest {
  image: string  // base64 encoded
}

interface PredictionResponse {
  prediction: string      // "A", "B", etc.
  confidence: number     // 0.0 to 1.0
  processing_time?: number
}
```

#### Backend → AI Service
```python
# POST /predict
{
  "image": [[[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]]  # Normalized numpy array as nested list
}

# Response
{
  "prediction": "A",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "landmarks": [...],  # Optional
  "processing_time": 0.1
}
```

- **AI Service**: Always use port 8001

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Backend (.env)
AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8001
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"]

# AI Service (.env)
INFERENCE_PORT=8001
MODEL_PATH=models/asl_classifier.h5
```

#### Dependency Conflicts
- Use exact version numbers in requirements.txt and package.json
- Document Python/Node versions in README
- Use virtual environments consistently

### Communication Protocols

#### Slack/Discord Channels
- **#general**: Daily updates and announcements
- **#frontend**: Frontend-specific discussions
- **#backend**: Backend and API discussions
